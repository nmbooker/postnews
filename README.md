## Features
Support for posting to servers running on port 119.  Default is localhost but can be another machine.
Message body is read from stdin, like with BSD mailx.
Support for logging in interactively with authinfo.

## Planned Features
See https://github.com/nmbooker/postnews/issues?labels=feature for progress
and features in latest version.

## Development status

I'll not be developing this actively any further until further notice.
My need to post news to NNTP news servers has disappeared, at least for now.

Please feel free to fork this project, or use the source code in your
own projects, under the terms of the GPL v2.
